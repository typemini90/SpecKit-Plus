## How to Use

1. **General Questions**: Type any question about robotics, AI, or textbook content in the input field
2. **Selection-Based Questions**:
   - Select text from anywhere on this page (or any textbook page)
   - Click the "Ask about selected text" button
   - The input field will be pre-filled with the selected text
   - Add your specific question about the selected content
   - Press Send to get an answer based only on that text

The chatbot uses our RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system to provide accurate answers based on the textbook content. For general questions, it searches the entire knowledge base. For selection-based questions, it answers only based on the specific text you've selected.
