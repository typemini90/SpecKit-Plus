# CHAPTER 4
## Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent the convergence of perception, cognition, and action in embodied AI. This module explores how visual processing, language understanding, and robotic control can be integrated to create intelligent agents capable of interacting naturally with their environment.

## Interactive Neural Processing

Experiment with how VLA systems process multi-modal inputs:
