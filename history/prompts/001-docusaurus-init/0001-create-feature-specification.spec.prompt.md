--- id: 0001 title: Create feature specification stage: spec date: 2025-12-05 surface: agent model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 feature: 001-docusaurus-init branch: 001-docusaurus-init user: user command: /sp.specify labels: [specification, feature-initialization] links:   spec: /home/giaic/code/dockathon/specs/001-docusaurus-init/spec.md   ticket: null   adr: null   pr: null files:   - specs/001-docusaurus-init/spec.md   - specs/001-docusaurus-init/checklists/requirements.md tests:  ---  ## Prompt  ```text "Feature 001: Project Initialization. 1. Initialize a new Docusaurus 3.9 site in the current directory (use 'classic' template+ts) for this use the context7 mcp server to read Docusaurus and 1st understand Docusaurus clearly then do hands-on. 2. Update 'docusaurus.config.js':    - Title: 'Embodied Intelligence'    - Tagline: 'Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics'    - Organization Name: 'Panaversity'    - Project Name: 'embodied-intelligence-book' 3. Remove the default 'tutorial' and 'blog' folders/links. 4. Create the folder structure for our 4 Parts in 'docs/':    - '01-foundations'    - '02-simulation'    - '03-perception'    - '04-vla' 5. Create a dummy 'intro.md' in each folder so the build succeeds. 6.create a script that can use espeak on my local terminal. 7.then use use that log steps like i m calling a subagent or i m reading xyz file  bcz i m multitasking and not starring on your terminal most of the times" ```  ## Response snapshot  Successfully created and validated the feature specification for "Project Initialization (Docusaurus Site)". The spec is now technology-agnostic and ready for planning.  ## Outcome  - ✅ Impact: Feature specification created and validated. - 🧪 Tests: N/A - 📁 Files: specs/001-docusaurus-init/spec.md, specs/001-docusaurus-init/checklists/requirements.md - 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with planning using /sp.plan. - 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created a technology-agnostic spec after iterative refinement.  ## Evaluation notes (flywheel)  - Failure modes observed: Initial attempts to edit spec.md directly without reading it first. Corrected by reading the file and performing a single write. - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All specification quality checklist items passed. - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure the PHR creation process is robust against minor misconfigurations in feature names.
