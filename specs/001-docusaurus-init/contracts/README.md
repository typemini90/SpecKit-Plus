# API Contracts

For the `001-docusaurus-init` feature, there are no explicit API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) to generate. This feature primarily involves the setup and configuration of a static Docusaurus site and a local shell script for audible notifications. No external APIs or data exchange interfaces are defined or required at this planning stage.
